## Abstract
Knee injuries are a major cause of disability and early osteoarthritis, but accurate identification of specific structural damage remains challenging due to limitations of conventional isokinetic evaluation and subjective interpretation of isokinetic moment curves (IMC). This study developed A Multi-Modal Probabilistic Reconstruction Attention Network for Structural Knee Injury Classification via Isokinetic Moment Curves (MPAN), to enhance diagnostic precision. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 73 subjects with four knee injury types (ACL rupture, meniscal tear, PFJ lesion, combined injury) who underwent standardized isokinetic testing. IMC data was preprocessed, and a 16-modality space (temporal, frequency, geometric, dynamic, complexity) was constructed. MPAN integrated multi-modal attention fusion and probabilistic reconstruction strategy. Results showed outstanding performance: overall accuracy 0.873, AUC 0.945, macro-F1 0.687, significantly outperforming traditional machine learning methods. The probabilistic reconstruction strategy increased single-injury diagnosis ROC-AUC by 18.21%, especially improving complex combined injury identification. MPAN transforms traditional isokinetic testing into an intelligent system, providing a low-cost, efficient tool for knee injury classification. It paves the way for AI-driven biomechanics applications in musculoskeletal injury diagnosis and sports medicine.
